                <p>Abstract: </p>
                <p>The launch of text-based artificial Intelligence (AI) powered ChatGPT by OpenAI, the natural language processing method 
                    of communicating has been captivating the business world. Since its launch in November 2022, ChatGPT has been making waves in 
                    diverse areas ranging from customer care to healthcare, education to automobiles, and the financial world to communication technology.
                    This study presents the theoretical background, use of technology, and its applications in various business areas. The study aims to 
                    organize much talked about but less understood technological aspects from a modern technological disruption perspective and lays the agenda for
                    multidisciplinary research. Furthermore, we present AI-powered chatbot applications and business use cases vis-à-vis the uncertainties of using technology.
                    Finally, we conclude by stating our thoughts regarding the direction of technology so that ChatGPT could benefit the business world.</p>
